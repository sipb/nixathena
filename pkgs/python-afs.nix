    # Without this hack, Python and OpenAFS have competing lock.h files, and we
    # need OpenAFS's to win but Python's does win. Until Python 3.15 comes out,
    # we force OpenAFS's headers to come before Python's when building
    # python-afs. This is a little tricky, because Python's headers use -I by
    # default while OpenAFS's use -isystem, and -I headers all come before
    # -isystem ones. However, if we add Python headers with -isystem at the
    # start of the compiler command, Python's -I will be treated as a dup of a
    # system header, and Python's headers will be moved to the system section
    # of the search path. *However*, because they're at the *start* of the
    # search path, they'll still beat OpenAFS, so we need to also add -isystem
    # for OpenAFS at the start of the compiler command, so the relative order
    # among the system section is correct.
